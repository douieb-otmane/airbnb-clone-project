## 🧩 Feature Breakdown

This Airbnb Clone project replicates the core functionalities of the Airbnb platform. Below is a detailed breakdown of each major feature and its purpose within the application.

---

### 👤 User Management

Handles user registration, login, and authentication. Users can create accounts as guests or hosts, manage their profiles, and securely access the platform.

---

### 🏠 Property Management

Enables hosts to list, edit, and manage their properties. Each listing includes details like title, description, location, price, and availability, making it searchable by users.

---

### 📆 Booking System

Allows users to book available properties for selected dates. It manages date availability, prevents overlapping reservations, and calculates the total cost of the booking.

---

### ⭐ Reviews and Ratings

Guests can leave reviews and ratings after completing a stay. This feature builds trust and transparency between users and helps others evaluate listings.

---

### 💳 Payments

Facilitates secure payment processing for bookings. Users can pay for their reservations, and hosts receive confirmation once payments are completed.

## 🔐 API Security

Securing the backend APIs is essential to protect sensitive user information, prevent abuse, and ensure the integrity of the platform. This section outlines the key security measures applied in this project.

---

### 🔑 Authentication

User authentication ensures that only verified users can access their accounts and perform actions. We use techniques such as token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) to validate user identity and secure each session.

**Why It Matters:** Prevents unauthorized access to user accounts and personal data.

---

### 🛡️ Authorization

Once authenticated, users must only be allowed to perform actions they are permitted to do. Role-based access control (RBAC) is used to ensure, for example, that a guest cannot edit a host's property.

**Why It Matters:** Protects system integrity by preventing privilege escalation and unauthorized data manipulation.

---

### 🚦 Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is used to restrict the number of requests a client can make within a time period. This helps defend against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and prevents API abuse.

**Why It Matters:** Preserves server resources and ensures fair use of the platform.

---

### 🔒 Data Encryption

Sensitive data such as passwords are encrypted using hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt). All communications are secured with HTTPS to protect data in transit.

**Why It Matters:** Ensures that user credentials and payment details cannot be intercepted or stolen.

---

### 🧪 Input Validation & Sanitization

All inputs are validated and sanitized to protect against common threats like SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Why It Matters:** Prevents malicious users from exploiting system vulnerabilities.
